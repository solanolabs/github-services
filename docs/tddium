Tddium Continuous Integration


Install Notes
-------------

Tddium will automatically enable this hook for every repository configured for a GitHub-connected account.

To configure by hand (no OAuth needed):

1. Go to the Tddium repo detail page for this repo
2. Enter the Repo token

Whenever you push, delete a branch, open or update a pull request, Tddium will do the right thing, automatically.
