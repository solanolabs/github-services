Install Notes
-------------

This hook will be automatically configured for GitHub repos you've configured
with a connected Solano CI account.

If you don't want to connect your Github account, or you don't want to give
Solano CI `repo` privileges, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Solano CI dashboard
2. Open the Configuration page for this repo and click on the 'CI Setup' section
3. Copy the hex value listed under 'CI Token'
4. Paste the token below.
5. Install Solano CI's repo-specific public key into this repo's deploy keys.  

You can safely leave the Override URL field blank.

Supported Events
----------------

Solano CI monitors all events on your repo, but it currently only acts on:

- push
- create a branch
- delete a branch
- open, close, synchronize pull requests
